## Rationale

The purpose of this project is to offer safe migrations for upgrading and downgrading databases that store datalake query metadata and metrics.

## Installation

This is meant to be used with [Trino](https://github.com/trinodb/trino) and models data based on Trino's query metrics. This has been tested with [Trino 379](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/releases/tag/379) and is backwards compatible to [Trino 363](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/releases/tag/363). Compatibility beyond this range is not guaranteed.

Before running this you will need to create a new database `datalake_analytics` with a schema called `datalake_metrics`. This is done by hand and is a one-time configuration.

Alembic is set up to read an SQL connection string from the environment variable `SQLALCHEMY_URL`.

You may also set uncomment `sqlalchemy.url` in `alembic.local.ini` and set the connection string there.

Run `alembic -c alembic.local.ini upgrade head` to upgrade the DB to the newest revision.

Run `alembic -c alembic.local.ini downgrade -1` to downgrade the DB one revision.
